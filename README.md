## :rocket: Description:

How much time do you spend using the computer?
It is already known of the importance for health and productivity to take breaks from work to get around.

The Flow app facilitates time and health management, based on the Pomodoro method.

<strong> At each 25-minute focal cycle, you receive intervals with missions based on meditation, stretching, exercises and eye care. </strong>

For each mission completed, you receive a score for leveling up.

Simple and easy.
